// Test script to demonstrate balance state reversal
// This would be run in the browser console or as a Node.js script

console.log('=== Balance State Reversal Test ===');

// Simulated test scenario:
console.log(`
SCENARIO:
1. Player has a product charge of $100 (debit receipt)
2. Player makes payment of $100 (credit receipt linked to debit)
3. Balance should be $0 (fully paid)
4. Transaction is deleted
5. Balance should revert to $100 (unpaid product charge)
6. Transaction is restored  
7. Balance should return to $0 (fully paid)

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Before payment: Outstanding balance = $100
- After payment: Outstanding balance = $0  
- After delete: Outstanding balance = $100 (receipt removed, debit unlinked)
- After restore: Outstanding balance = $0 (receipt restored, debit linked again)
`);

// Key implementation points:
console.log(`
KEY FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
1. Complete Receipt Deletion: Instead of soft-deleting receipts, we completely remove them so they don't affect balance calculations at all
2. Sibling Relationship Cleanup: When deleting a payment, we remove the receipt from its sibling's relationship list, making the debit appear unpaid again
3. Full State Backup: We backup all receipt data and relationships for complete restoration
4. Atomic Operations: All changes happen in a single batch to ensure consistency

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Deleted receipts are completely removed from Firestore (not just marked as deleted)
- Sibling receipts have their siblingReceiptRefs updated to remove deleted receipts
- Balance calculations naturally exclude deleted receipts since they no longer exist
- Restoration recreates the deleted receipts with original data and relationships
