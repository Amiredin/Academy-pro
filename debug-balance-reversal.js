PROBLEM DIAGNOSIS:
The issue was that balance calculations were cached in user documents and not updated after transaction deletion.

FIXED IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Complete Receipt Deletion: Receipts are fully removed from Firestore (not soft deleted)
2. Sibling Relationship Cleanup: Debit receipts have broken links to deleted credits
3. Balance Recalculation: After deletion/restoration, we trigger balance recalculation
4. Debug Logging: Added extensive logging to track balance changes

KEY FIXES APPLIED:
âœ… batch.delete(receiptRef) - Completely removes credit receipts
âœ… Clean sibling relationships - Debit receipts show as unpaid 
âœ… recalculateAndUpdateUserBalance() - Updates cached balances
âœ… recalculateAndUpdateUserOutstandingAndCredits() - Updates organization-specific balances

WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NOW:
1. Before Payment: Player owes $100 (debit receipt exists)
2. After Payment: Player owes $0 (credit receipt links to debit)
3. After Transaction Deletion: Player owes $100 (credit deleted, debit unlinked, balances recalculated)
4. After Transaction Restoration: Player owes $0 (credit restored, debit relinked, balances recalculated)

DEBUGGING STEPS:
1. Check browser console for detailed balance calculation logs
2. Look for messages like "ðŸ’° Current balance for user X before deletion"
3. Verify "âœ… Balance recalculated for user X" with new values
4. Confirm outstanding debits increase and available credits decrease after deletion
